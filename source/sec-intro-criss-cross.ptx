<introduction>
<p>Below we will describe a mathematically-curious game. The original activity can be found at <url href="https://mathcircles.org/activity/game-of-criss-cross/"  visual="mathcircles.org"> Math Circles Activity Site</url> and was authored by Sam Vandervelde.

<title>Objectives</title>
<li><p>Be the last player to add a line segment to the board. (This player is the winner.)</p></li>
<li><p>Predict who will win and who will lose based on the set up of the game.</p></li>
<li><p>Spot patterns and justify them.</p></li>

         <title>Rules</title>
<p>
To play, two players will alternate turns until one of the players is unable to make a move. To begin, decide who will play first then create a
game board by drawing <m>x</m> number of dots. On each turn, draw a segment between
any pair of dots which does not intersect any of the existing segments.  This is illustrated in <xref ref="criss-cross-moves"/>

<p>
The winner is the last person able to make a legal move.  A completed game is shows in <xref ref = "fig-criss-gross-game"/>.

<p>Note: You can play this by yourself. This can be done by writing in two different colors. Designate one color as player one and the other as player two.
</p>


<p>
Make a copy of the <xref ref = "criss-cross-table"/> score table based on the number of dots used. The first row has been filled in. These values can be seen based on the completed game illustrated in <xref ref = "fig-criss-cross-game"/>. However, in order to complete the rest of the table, you will need the following definitions:
<ul>
<li><p> The dots are called <em>vertices</em> and denoted by <m>V</m></p></li>
<li><p> The segments are called <em>edges</em> and denoted by <m>E</m></p></li>
<li><p> The outlined regions are called <em>faces</em> and denoted by <m>F</m></p></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Based on the table, what patterns do you see? Can you prove/justify those patterns? On a piece of paper try to write down the patterns and justifications.</p>
